</center>
<p>This tutorial introduces the Stata commands associated with the content in <strong>Module 5: Regression</strong>.</p>
<p>We use data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Malawi in which individuals were provided varying incentives to learn their HIV status after receiving an HIV test.<sup><a href="#myfootnote1">1</a></sup> The data can be downloaded <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/aer/data/dec08/20060732_data.zip">here</a> or from the course web page. The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab provides a <a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/demand-and-impact-learning-hiv-status-malawi">detailed description</a> of the intervention.</p>
<p>The data is contained in a compressed (zip) file. The extracted file contains the Stata .do files used by the author, the data, and a document describing the data. We will use the data (Thornton HIV Testing AER.dta) and the PDF describing the data (Readme.pdf) in this tutorial.</p>
<h2><a href="#part-1-getting-started" id="part-1-getting-started">Part 1: Getting started</a></h2>
<p>All of the commands in this tutorial should be written in a single Stata .do file. An example Module 5 .do file can be downloaded from the course page. To start a .do file, type <code>doedit</code> into the Stata command line then hit enter. You should save the file to a location where you will remember by selecting <code>File</code> then <code>Save as</code> from the menu (the upper left corner) of the .do file.</p>
<p>At the start of the .do file, enter the commands <code>drop _all</code> and <code>set more off</code>. The first command removes any data from Stata&rsquo;s memory so that the script can run cleanly. The second command instructs Stata to execute the entire .do file at once instead of waiting for keyboard inputs at certain points. Both commands should go at the start of almost every .do file.</p>
<p>In the answer, note that any line that begins with a period and then space is the input (you should only type the command that follows in the .do file). Any other lines are outputs from Stata.</p>

<p>The next step is to use the command <code>cd</code> to set the working directory to the folder containing the data. For help using the command, you may type <code>help cd</code> in the Stata command line and then hit enter.<sup><a href="#myfootnote1">2</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Execution</strong></p>
<p>Suppose that the data is stored in the directory <code>/mass_storage/WB/Module 5/Data</code>. Then the command would be</p>
<pre><code>. cd &quot;/mass_storage/WB/Module 5/Data&quot;
/mass_storage/WB/Module 5/Data

</code></pre>
<hr />
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> The quotations are only necessary if there are spaces in the folder path. On Windows, a backslash may be used in place of a forward slash, but forward slashes are recommended for compatibility with other operating systems.</p>
<hr />
</details>
<p>Finally, we need to input the data. Since the data is in Stata (.dta) format, we use the command <code>use</code>. Type <code>help use</code> in the Stata command line and then hit enter for an explanation of how this command works. After importing the file, use the command <code>describe</code> to describe the data.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong> The quotations around the file name are necessary since there are spaces in the name. The option <code>clear</code> is not necessary since there is no data in Stata&rsquo;s memory, but is recommended in case you only run part of the .do file.</p>

<h2><a href="#part-2-factor-variables" id="part-2-factor-variables">Part 2: Factor variables</a></h2>
<p>A <strong>factor variable</strong> is a variable in which each value represents a specific value or category. The values of a factor variable are called <strong>levels</strong>. A binary variable is a factor variable with 2 levels. For instance, the variable treatment status typically has the levels &ldquo;Treatment&rdquo; and &ldquo;Control.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A factor variable can also have more than 2 levels. For example, the variable <code>site</code> in the HIV data that we are using records the &ldquo;region of Malawi where the study was conducted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Factor variables may be stored as <strong>string</strong> variables. For example, the values of the variable treatment could be &ldquo;Treatment&rdquo; and &ldquo;Control&rdquo; in Stata. They can also be stored as <strong>numeric</strong> variables in which numbers are used to represent levels. For instance, 0 could represent control and 1 could represent treatment. To use factor variables in Stata, they must be in a numeric format.</p>
<p>The variable <code>tinc</code> indicates the value of the financial incentive given to the study participant. Generate a new variable called <code>treat_string</code> that takes on a value of &ldquo;Treatment&rdquo; if the participant received a positive incentive, &ldquo;Control&rdquo; if they received 0 incentive, and missing (for strings this is &quot;&quot;) if <code>tinc</code> is missing.</p>
<details>
<summary>Task 4</summary>
<hr />
<p><strong>Task</strong></p>
<p>Generate a string variable called <code>treat_string</code> that takes on a value of &ldquo;Treatment&rdquo; if <code>tinc</code> is positive, and is given a value of &ldquo;Control&rdquo; if <code>tinc</code> is 0. The variable <code>treat_string</code> should be coded as missing if <code>tinc</code> is missing.</p>

. replace treat_string = &quot;&quot; if missing(tinc)
(1,919 real changes made)

</code></pre>
<hr />
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> There are multiple ways to accomplish this task. To see if your approach is valid, generate a new variable called <code>treat2</code> using the method included here, then enter the command <code>assert treat_string == treat2</code>. If Stata returns &ldquo;assertion is false&rdquo; in red, you made a mistake. Otherwise, your method is fine.</p>
<hr />
</details>
<p>The variable that we just generated is a string variable, but we need it to be in numeric format for use in analysis. Use the <code>generate</code> command to obtain a numeric variable called <code>treatment</code> that takes on a value of 0 if <code>treat_string</code> is equal to &ldquo;Control&rdquo;, 1 if it is equal to &ldquo;Treatment,&rdquo; and is given a missing value if <code>treat_string</code> is missing. Label the values of the variable and the variable itself appropriately. (Hint: Look for the <code>group</code> command in <code>egen</code> and use the <code>label</code> option.) Labeling a variable shows &ldquo;Treatment&rdquo; instead of 1 when the Stata user looks at it, but the data is still stored as a number. This makes it clear what each category is while getting the variable into a usable format.</p>

<p>Generate a numeric variable called <code>treatment</code> that takes on a value of 0 if <code>treat_string</code> is equal to &ldquo;Control&rdquo;, 1 if it is equal to &ldquo;Treatment,&rdquo; and is given a missing value if <code>treat_string</code> is missing. Label the variable <code>treatment</code> and its values appropriately.</p>

</details>
<p>We may count the number of times each level of a factor variable occurs using the <code>tabulate</code> Stata command. We may also use Stata for a cross tabulation in which we count the number of times levels of one factor variable occur within each level of another. This uses the same command.

<p><strong>Notes:</strong> The dependent variable is always listed first followed by all independent variables. The option <code>robust</code> instructs Stata to calculate standard errors that are robust to heteroskedasticity<sup><a href="#myfootnote3">3</a></sup>. A binary dependent variable introduces heteroskedasticity by construction, so this option is necessary.</p>
<p>The treatment effect is 0.4506, or about 45 percentage points, compared to a control group average, measured by the constant term, of about 34 percent (0.3387).  The treatment effect has a p-value of 0.000, and the 95% confidence interval is from about 41 to 49 percentage points.</p>

<p>The treatment effect may be different between men and women. Include an interaction between <code>treatment</code> and <code>male</code> to test for heterogeneous treatment effects.

<p>We cannot conclude that the treatment effect is different for men than for women, but perhaps financial incentives matter more to older individuals. Run a regression to test this hypothesis.</p>
