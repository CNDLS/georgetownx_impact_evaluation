# Module 4 Stata Tutorial

This tutorial introduces the Stata commands associated with the content in __Module 4: Statistical inference (advanced)__.

We will use data from a randomized controlled trial by Alessandro Tarozzi, Aprajit Mahajan, Brian Blackburn, Dan Kopf, Lakshmi Krishnan, and Joanne Yoong. They evaluated the uptake of insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs), comparing one treatment group that was offered micro-consumer loans, a second treatment group that received free nets, and a control group (citation: Tarozzi, Alessandro, Aprajit Mahajan, Brian Blackburn, Dan Kopf, Lakshmi Krishnan, and Joanne Yoong. 2014. "Micro-loans, Insecticide-Treated Bednets, and Malaria: Evidence from a Randomized Controlled Trial in Orissa, India." American Economic Review, 104 (7): 1909-41.). The study took place in Orissa, India. The data can be downloaded here (https://www.aeaweb.org/aer/data/10407/20110888_data.zip) or from the course page.

As in prior exercises, the data will be downloaded as a compressed (zip) file. You should unzip it before using the dta file. There are a number of folders and files in the unzipped directory. We will only use the file called `panel_biomarkers.dta` in this exercise.

## Part 1: Getting started

All of the commands in this tutorial should be written in a single Stata .do file. An example Module 4 .do file can be downloaded from the course page. To start a .do file, type doedit into the Stata command line then hit enter. You should save the file to a location where you will remember by selecting **File** then **Save as** from the menu (the upper left corner) of the .do file.

Just like in Module 3, at the start of the .do file, enter the commands `drop _all` and `set more off`. Then import and describe the data. Confirm that there are 18,569 observations and 115 variables. 

__Task 1:__ Clear Stataâ€™s memory, set the more option to off, and describe the data.

__Execution 1:__

Note that the working directory and path to the `panel_biomarkers.dta` file in this example may differ on your computer. 

```
. cd "C:\\Module 4"

. use "Data/TarozziEtAlReplicationFiles/panel_biomarkers.dta", clear 

. 
. describe

## Part 2: Summary statistics, confidence intervals, and t-tests

Now that we have imported the data, we will begin to examine it further. In the last exercise, we examined how we could use theÂ `summarize`Â command to obtain the sample average and standard deviation. In this module, we will calculate an estimate of theÂ populationÂ mean with measures of confidence. Since we use the sample average to estimate the population mean, the estimate of the population mean can be read directly fromÂ the output of the `summarize` command. However, theÂ `summarize` command does not tell us how confident we can be in that estimate.

Let's consider `survey_m61`, a variable that measures the total number of "reported malaria episodes" that the individual experienced in the prior 6 months.  We can estimate the population mean of this variable and a 95% confidence interval using a single command,Â `ci mean`.

__Task 2:__

Estimate a 95% confidence interval of the population mean of `survey_m61`. 

__Execution 2:__

```
. ci mean survey_m61

    Variable |        Obs        Mean    Std. Err.       [95% Conf. Interval]
-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------
  survey_m61 |     17,202    .0920242    .0024892        .0871452    .0969032

```

This output shows that the sample average is 0.0920242.  That is, on average, individuals in the sample experienced this many episodes of malaria, or more naturally, about one in ten people reported having malaria in the last 6 months.

Second, the table shows that we can state with 95% confidence that the population mean of the number of malaria episodes in the past 6 months falls between .0871452 and .0969032.

The `ci mean` command can also be used to calculate other confidence intervals (enter `help ci mean` to see what's possible). For example, we can calculate 90% and 99% confidence intervals of the population average of `survey_m61`.

__Task 3:__

Estimate a 90% and 99% confidence interval of the population mean of `survey_m61`. 

__Execution 3:__ 

```
. *90% CI
. ci mean survey_m61, level(90)

    Variable |        Obs        Mean    Std. Err.       [90% Conf. Interval]
-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------
  survey_m61 |     17,202    .0920242    .0024892        .0879297    .0961187

. 
. *99% CI
. ci mean survey_m61, level(99)

    Variable |        Obs        Mean    Std. Err.       [99% Conf. Interval]
-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------
  survey_m61 |     17,202    .0920242    .0024892        .0856118    .0984366

```

So there's a 90% chance that the population mean falls between .0879297 and 0961187, and a 99% chance that it falls between .0856118 and .0984366. 

Suppose we want to calculate how confident we can be that the population average ofÂ `survey_m61`Â is not equal to 1.  Just looking at the confidence interval above, this seems rather unlikely, but conducting a t-test lets us quantify just how unlikely it is.  We first run a t-test using theÂ `ttest`Â command, then examine at the p-value from the test. Run the test and determine the confidence with which we can reject the null hypothesis that the population average equals 1.

__Task 4:__

Test the null hypothesis that the population mean of `survey_m61` equals 1 against the alternative hypothesis that the population average is not equal to 1. What are the t-score and p-value of the test?

__Execution 4:__ 


```
. ttest survey_m61 == 1

One-sample t test
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Variable |     Obs        Mean    Std. Err.   Std. Dev.   [95% Conf. Interval]

    mean = mean(survey_m61)                                       t = -3.6e+02
Ho: mean = 1                                     degrees of freedom =    17201

    Ha: mean < 1                 Ha: mean != 1                 Ha: mean > 1
 Pr(T < t) = 0.0000         Pr(|T| > |t|) = 0.0000          Pr(T > t) = 1.0000

``` 

Based on the output from Stata, the t-score of the test is about `-3.6*10^2` or `-360`. The parameter `Pr(|T| > |t|) = 0.0000` displays the p-value associated with the test that `survey_m61=1` against the alternative hypothesis that `survey_m61!=1`. You may ignore `Pr(T < t) = 0.0000` and `Pr(T > t) = 1.0000` as they report the results of so-called "one-sided t-tests tests" that we do not cover in this course.

In this case, we see that the p-value is less than 0.00005 (it is rounded to 0.0000). Hence, it is very unlikely that the population means equals 1. 

Let's look at a more probable value of the population mean of `survey_m61`. Test the null hypothesis that the population mean of `survey_m61` equals `0.095` against the alternative hypothesis that the population average is not equal to 0.095. 

__Task 5:__

Run a t-test testing the null hypothesis that the population mean of `survey_m61` equals 0.095 against the alternative hypothesis that the population average is not equal to 0.095. 

__Execution 5:__ 

```
. ttest survey_m61 == .095

One-sample t test
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Variable |     Obs        Mean    Std. Err.   Std. Dev.   [95% Conf. Interval]
---------+--------------------------------------------------------------------
surv~m61 |  17,202    .0920242    .0024892    .3264698    .0871452    .0969032
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    mean = mean(survey_m61)                                       t =  -1.1955
Ho: mean = .095                                  degrees of freedom =    17201

   Ha: mean < .095             Ha: mean != .095               Ha: mean > .095
 Pr(T < t) = 0.1160         Pr(|T| > |t|) = 0.2319          Pr(T > t) = 0.8840

```

In this case, the p-value is relatively large at `0.2319`. So we can only say that the population mean is not equal to `0.095` with about `73%` confidence. This makes sense since the 90% confidence interval of the population mean we calculated earlier includes this value. In other words, the population mean of `survey_m61` is not different from `0.095` by a statistically significant margin. 

## Part 3: Comparing means

So far, we have learned how to estimate the population mean of a variable and use theÂ `ttest`Â command to test the hypothesis that the population mean equals a particular value. Next, we will use theÂ `ttest`Â command to compare 2 means â€“ in particular, to ask if they are different.

Suppose that we aim to test if there is a difference in the proportion of people that reported using a net during the follow-up survey among the group that was offered a loan and the control group. 

Perform this test by generating the appropriate variable (hint: `arm_mf` indicates that the respondent was offered the loan and `arm_c` indicates that they were part of the control group) and then performing a t-test. You should look at the documentation for a two-sample t-test using groups. There are several other possible t-tests, but we will not cover them in this course.

__Task 6:__

Run a t-test to determine whether the average of `netlast_fup` is different among the control group and treatment group that was offered a loan.

__Execution 6:__ 

```
. generate treat_loan = 1 if arm_mf == 1
(12,377 missing values generated)

. replace treat_loan = 0 if arm_c == 1
(5,981 real changes made)

. 
. label define treat_loan 0 "Control" 1 "MF loan"

. label val treat_loan treat_loan

. 
. ttest netlast_fup, by(treat_loan)

    diff = mean(Control) - mean(MF loan)                          t = -11.3678
Ho: diff = 0                                     degrees of freedom =     5854

    Ha: diff < 0                 Ha: diff != 0                 Ha: diff > 0
 Pr(T < t) = 0.0000         Pr(|T| > |t|) = 0.0000          Pr(T > t) = 1.0000

```

__Notes:__ We cannot use `by(arm_mf)` since respondents offered a free net would have an `arm_mf` value of 0. That would mean that we were testing the rate of people that used a net among the MF loan group to people in either the control or free net group. The way that we generated `treat_loan`, we are comparing the MF loan group to the control group and not considering the free net group in the calculations. 

Respondents that were offered the loan to purchase a net were more likely to report sleeping under a net the prior night be a statistically significant margin. In addition, by comparing the means we can see that this gap was over 10 percentage points. Hence, offering loans to purchase insecticide-treated bed-nets was successful at increasing their use. 

We may also want to compare the proportion of respondents that reported sleeping under a net in the two treatment groups: those that were offered a loan and those that received a free net. Perform another t-test to determine if net use is higher among the group that received free nets than the group that was offered a loan to purchase a net.

__Task 7:__

Run a t-test to determine whether the average of `netlast_fup` is different among the treatment group that was offered a loan and the treatment group that was given a free bed net. 

__Execution 7:__ 

```
. generate treat_free = 1 if arm_free == 1
(12,173 missing values generated)

. replace treat_free = 0 if arm_mf == 1
(6,192 real changes made)

. 
. label define treat_free 0 "MF Loan" 1 "Free"

. 
. ttest netlast_fup, by(treat_free)

```

Respondents that were given a free bed net were over 20 percentage points more likely to report sleeping under a net the prior night than respondents that were offered a loan to purchase a bed net. This difference is statistically significant. This makes sense since the group that was offered a loan still had to pay for a net.
